SmartShanghai Web scraping project.




# Running Spider
Main spider is in the housing.py file. Item pipeline will append jsonline rows to output/listings.jl.

To run the spider need to simply run the command at the root project folder.

```
scrapy crawl ss_housing      
```

# Roadmap

Want to prevent scraper from making requests to already crawled URLs. Item pipeline will already drop these listings and prevent them from being
added to the output file, but having the schedulers request and download these pages is wasting time.
